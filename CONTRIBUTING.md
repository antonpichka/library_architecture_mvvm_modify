## Creating a Pull Request

Before creating a pull request please (otherwise you won't be able to add your version of the library):

1. Fork the repository.
2. Copy the files you need from the folder `library_architecture_mvvm_modify` and place them in your folder under this name `library_architecture_mvvm_modify_{anyName}` ({anyName} your name).
3. Install all dependencies (`flutter packages get` or `pub get`).
4. There must result be a path `https://github.com/JacobOdd/library_architecture_mvvm_modify/tree/main/packages/library_architecture_mvvm_modify_{anyName}`

WARNING: Yes you are adding your own version of the library and you will not be able to change the existing original library, and if your commits affect an existing original library or other files, then the pull request will not be accepted. If you want me to review the changes, then there is an "issue" tab (There you can suggest what needs to be added, or fix the error)
